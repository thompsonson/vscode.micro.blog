# Note on External Conversation Summary Document

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Historical Document Notice

The "Conversation Summary" document referenced in discussions is a **historical planning document** from the early stages of this project. It does not reflect the current state of the extension.

### Context

- **Document Date**: Early project planning phase (pre-v0.1.0)
- **Document Status**: Outdated - represents initial conservative planning
- **Current Reality**: Project has far exceeded original MVP goals

### Key Discrepancies

The conversation summary shows:
- ‚úÖ "MVP Phase 1 Complete" (read-only browsing)
- üéØ "Phase 2 Planning" (content creation)
- üõ†Ô∏è "Discussing build tooling"

The actual project state:
- ‚úÖ Full feature set implemented (v0.3.20250711)
- ‚úÖ Content creation, publishing, and media management working
- ‚úÖ 122+ tests passing with established development workflow
- ‚úÖ Active alpha release with real users

### For Accurate Information

Please refer to:
- **README.md** - Current features and user guide
- **CURRENT_STATUS.md** - Accurate project state
- **PROJECT_HISTORY.md** - How we got here
- **CLAUDE.md** - Technical implementation details

### Why This Happened

During rapid development, the team successfully implemented features much faster than originally planned. The conversation summary was never updated to reflect this progress, creating confusion when compared to current documentation.
